=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 optimal_f ($probability, $payoff)

Returns the optimal L<fraction|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion> of bankroll to wager, using the Kelly Criterion, given the C<$probability> and C<$payoff>. Payoff should be the net odds of the wager, so the value of 3-to-1 would be 3. The C<optimal_f()> sub is exported by default.

=head1 CONVERTING ODDS

Odds are usually presented in one of three styles: decimal, fraction or American. The C<optimal_f> sub requires the net decimal odds. These odds are all equal:

    Type      Example    Net Odds
    ----      --------   --------
    Decimal   4.0        3.0
    Fraction  3/1        3.0
    American  +300       3.0

The different odds representations are also explained L<here|http://www.olbg.com/school/lesson10.htm>.
